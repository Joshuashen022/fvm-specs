# Error Conditions

This document specifies the error conditions in the FVM and the associated error codes/numbers.

## Exit Codes

Exit codes are numeric, 32bit integer codes that are returned when an actor exits both successfully and in error.
Exit codes appear on-chain inside the message receipt, and therefore form part of consensus.

We classify exit codes as "normal" and "abnormal".

The only _normal_ exit code is `0`, or `Ok`. The `Ok` exit code indicates that the message was
applied successfully.

All other exit codes are _abnormal_ and indicate that the message _was not_ applied and that the
chain state _was not_ updated.

### System "Abnormal Exit" Codes

System abnormal exit codes are generated by the VM itself to indicate that the message itself failed
to apply. These exit codes will never be observed or returned directly by actors.

| Code  | Status                     | Description                                               |
|-------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | `SysErrSenderInvalid`      | sender doesn't exist                                      |
| 2     | `SysErrSenderStateInvalid` | sender's message shouldn't have been included             |
| 3     | reserved                   |                                                           |
| 4     | `SysErrActorPanic`         | message receiver trapped                                  |
| 5     | `SysErrInvalidReceiver`    | receiver doesn't exist and can't be automatically created |
| 6     | `SysErrInsufficientFunds`  | sender didn't have the requisite funds                    |
| 7     | `SysErrOutOfGas`           | out of gas                                                |
| 8     | reserved                   |                                                           |
| 9     | `SysErrIllegalActor`       | message receiver made an unrecoverable illegal syscall    |
| 10    | `SysErrAssertionFailed`    | some internal assertion failed                            |
| 11-15 | reserved                   |                                                           |

Examples:

1. If a message sender doesn't exist on-chain, the VM will return a receipt with the
   `ExitCode::SysErrSenderInvalid` abnormal exit code.
2. If an actor calls `vm::abort` with a system abnormal exit code, the send to that actor
   will fail with the `ExitCode::ErrIllegalActor` _syscall error_. If this is a top-level send (the
   execution of an on-chain message), the `ExitCode::SysErrIllegalActor` system exit code will be
   recorded as the messages exit code.
3. If a message runs out of gas, the VM will return a receipt with the `ExitCode::SysErrOutOfGas`
   abnormal exit code.

Changes from pre-FVM Filecoin:

1. Removed `ExitCode::SysErrInvalidMethod` (3). Dispatch is now handled inside actor code.
2. Removed `ExitCode::SysErrForbidden` (8). Caller verification is a userspace operation, we'll now
   exit with `ExitCode::ErrForbidden`.
4. Replaced `ExitCode::SysErrIllegalArgument` with `ExitCode::SysErrAssertionFailed` to more
   accurately reflect its usage. When this appears on-chain, it means that a message hit some
   internal Filecoin assert that shouldn't happen.

### Standard "Abnormal Exit" Codes

Standard abnormal exit codes are codes returned by actors to indicate common abnormal exit conditions.

| Code  | Status                 | Description                                         |
|-------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 16    | `ErrIllegalArgument`   | invalid message parameters                          |
| 17    | `ErrNotFound`          | message referenced something that doesn't exist     |
| 18    | `ErrForbidden`         | operation forbidden                                 |
| 19    | `ErrInsufficientFunds` | insufficient funds for operation                    |
| 20    | `ErrIllegalState`      | the actor is in an illegal state                    |
| 21    | `ErrSerialization`     | actor failed to serialize or deserialize some state |
| 22    | `ErrInvalidMethod`     | specified method does not exist                     |
| 23    | `ErrUnspecified`       | the actor failed with an unspecified error          |
| 24-31 | reserved               |                                                     |

Changes from pre-FVM Filecoin:

1. Added `ExitCode::ErrInvalidMethod` (replacing `ExitCode::SysErrInvalidMethod`).
2. Added `ExitCode::ErrUnspecified`. This generally means "there's a bug and I have no idea what
   went wrong". The alternative would be for the actor to _panic_ (leading to an
   `ExitCode::ErrIllegalActor` syscall error), but it may be useful to distinguish between
   "crashing" and "something unknown went wrong".

## Syscall Error Numbers

Syscall error numbers (`ErrorNumber`) are returned by syscalls to actors. They indicate that the
syscall failed (without any side effects). The actor may choose to handle the error and continue, or
abort (usually with a standard "abnormal exit" code).

A return value of "0" means that the syscall succeeded.

| Number | Name                | Description                                            |
|--------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 1      | `IllegalArgument`   | invalid syscall parameters                             |
| 2      | `IllegalActor`      | actor is not in the correct state to perform operation |
| 3      | `LimitExceeded`     | some limit was exceeded (e.g. lookback limit)          |
| 4      | `AssertionFailed`   | some internal assertion failed                         |
| 5      | `InsufficientFunds` | attempted to send more than balance                    |
| 6      | `NotFound`          | resource not found                                     |
| 7      | `InvalidHandle`     | block handle invalid                                   |
| 8      | `IllegalCid`        | cid creation parameters (hash/length) were invalid     |
| 9      | `IllegalCodec`      | specified codec is not allowed                         |
| 10     | `Serialization`     | block format did not match specified codec             |

Changes from pre-FVM Filecoin:

Before the FVM, Filecoin didn't have a concept of syscall error numbers, only exit codes. However:

1. Pre-FVM, most syscalls returned string errors with no exit codes attached.
2. There is no reliable mapping from syscall errors to exit codes. For example:

    1. If a syscall returns with `ErrorNumber::IllegalArgument`, it means that an illegal argument was passed
       to the syscall.
    2. If an actor exits with `ExitCode::ErrIllegalArgument`, it means the message parameters weren't allowed.

    1 does not imply 2. An actor may pass illegal arguments to a syscall due to a bug in the actor,
    illegal state, etc.

**Notes:**

- We intentionally use `ErrorNumber::IllegalArgument` instead of `ErrorNumber::Serialization` in
    non-IPLD syscalls, even if we're using CBOR.
- There is no `ErrorNumber::Forbidden` syscall error number:
    - Calling a forbidden actor will result in an `ErrorNumber::Forbidden` exit code from that
      actor.
    - Calling a forbidden syscall is statically impossible as it will be impossible to _import_ said
        syscalls. I.e., actor deployment will fail.
- `ErrorNumber::AssertionFailed` is a special error that indicates that some internal assertion
    failed and that there is likely something wrong with a system actor or the Filecoin state-tree
    itself. It exists to allow the network to continue in the face of bugs where the network
    continuing is likely less harmful than the bug itself.

    It can't be caught by normal actors (and turns into a `ExitCode::SysErrAssertionFailed` abnormal
    exit code on-chain), but may be caught by some system actors (e.g., cron).

    Uses:

    - `actor::create_actor` fails because the init actor is in a bad state.
    - `actor::resolve_address` fails because the init actor is in a bad state.
